# **Landing page:** MegaRocket Gym
***
The purpose of this project is to creat a home page for the MegaRocket gym. The format is created in html, therefore the page can be accessed, however it does not have any added style, this will be incorporated in the future.

## **Second Week working:**
***
For this week i was working with the Visual Studio Code where i develop the index in HTML format acording with the parameters impose in the design of Figma, this work was realising with repositories tools, such as Git and Github. I were working with the support of the asynchronous material provided by the course, also with the documentation of [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp)  and when i finish in order to validate the code i used [AppDevTools](https://appdevtools.com/html-validator)

## **Page content:**
***
While working with the HTML document, I separated the body into the differential areas. I started with the header containing the name of the gym with a logo addition.

  ![header](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/126518237/228282092-7aca158a-fce0-47b1-8ae3-6f26bf1cf89b.png)

After that I made the drop-down menu with four links, two on the same page and another two that will take you to a secondary page, then you have the list of contact forms.

>Note: if you click in the links of the secondary page it will not take you anywhere because we just have the landing page for the moment.

After the menu i developed the main part, divided in five sections, the first one with the information about the gym purpose, the second one with information of the diferent areas of the page, the third one contains a form where you can deliver a message, the fourth section have the history of the gym and finally you got the last section with four list each one has its own information about activities and benefits of each kind of membership. 
>when we add CSS we will be able to put them in four consecutive columns like in the figma design.

At the end of the body i put the footer which contains the paragraph about copyright and three icons for the links of social medias 
>currently won't take you anywhere because the pages weren't created.

## **Third Week working:**
***
This week we learn about css in order to put style in the html document, we work with the objective that the page stay in some measure parameters which mean that the design shouldn't be responsive, only in pixel perfect; but even if we focus in the css we also had to make changes in the html documentation. Just like in the last week we work with the support of pages like [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) and [developer.mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/).
## **Page content:**
***
In this stage what we do with css was to create the style of the pages witch mean that we add some global parameters such as width or the font of the page, then we add some general specification that we organized this parts in classes or id that we incorporated in the html document, in orde to give to this partss background-color or font color. We were able to give a font, colors, borders and even arrange in columns or add space between the differents containers and adapt the images to the size that is most convenient.

Basically with the work of the second week we were able to create the base structure por the landing page, with this past week we were able to added style that is what will attract people to stay in the page and enjoy it.

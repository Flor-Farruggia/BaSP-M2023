# **Landing page:** MegaRocket Gym
***
The purpose of this project is to creat a home page for the MegaRocket gym. The format is created in html, therefore the page can be accessed, however it does not have any added style, this will be incorporated in the future.

## **Second Week working:**
***
For this week i was working with the Visual Studio Code where i develop the index in HTML format acording with the parameters impose in the design of Figma, this work was realising with repositories tools, such as Git and Github. I were working with the support of the asynchronous material provided by the course, also with the documentation of [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp)  and when i finish in order to validate the code i used [AppDevTools](https://appdevtools.com/html-validator)

## **Page content:**
***
While working with the HTML document, I separated the body into the differential areas. I started with the header containing the name of the gym with a logo addition.

  ![header](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/126518237/228282092-7aca158a-fce0-47b1-8ae3-6f26bf1cf89b.png)

After that I made the drop-down menu with four links, two on the same page and another two that will take you to a secondary page, then you have the list of contact forms.

>Note: if you click in the links of the secondary page it will not take you anywhere because we just have the landing page for the moment.

After the menu i developed the main part, divided in five sections, the first one with the information about the gym purpose, the second one with information of the diferent areas of the page, the third one contains a form where you can deliver a message, the fourth section have the history of the gym and finally you got the last section with four list each one has its own information about activities and benefits of each kind of membership. 
>when we add CSS we will be able to put them in four consecutive columns like in the figma design.

At the end of the body i put the footer which contains the paragraph about copyright and three icons for the links of social medias 
>currently won't take you anywhere because the pages weren't created.

## **Third Week working:**
***
This week we learn about css in order to put style in the html document, we work with the objective that the page stay in some measure parameters which mean that the design shouldn't be responsive, only in pixel perfect; but even if we focus in the css we also had to make changes in the html documentation. Just like in the last week we work with the support of pages like [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) and [developer.mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/).
## **Page content:**
***
In this stage what we do with css was to create the style of the pages witch mean that we add some global parameters such as width or the font of the page, then we add some general specification that we organized this parts in classes or id that we incorporated in the html document, in orde to give to this partss background-color or font color. We were able to give a font, colors, borders and even arrange in columns or add space between the differents containers and adapt the images to the size that is most convenient.

Basically with the work of the second week we were able to create the base structure por the landing page, with this past week we were able to added style that is what will attract people to stay in the page and enjoy it. 
***
## **Fourth Week Working:**
***
This week we learn about responsive develop using tools like flexbox and media queries. First we had flexbox which is used for organized the components and containers, secondlywe had the media queries that are used to change the propoerties of the components when in the moment you change the size of the device you are using. Just like in the other weeks we work with the support of pages and the material.
## **page content:**
In this moment what we acomplish to created a website who is responsive to different measures, we try to keep the most similar design from the original in figma and we stablish a start point from the model of mobile first, then we were adding the difference with the media queries.
***
## **Fifth Week Working:**
***
This week we learn about the different programming languages, we focused on JavaScript which is a lightly typed language, we were given a series of exercises to put into practice the knowledge acquired from the material. The exercises were divided into six sections, these were developed in six js files indexed to an empty html document, first the exercise about variables and operators, the second exercise was about strings, the third about arrays, the fourth about the if-else loop, the fifth about for loop and the sixth was about functions. Like in the past weeks we worked with the videos provided in the asynchronous material. And for other side we continue the changes in the css document with the correction of the feedback, trying to perfect and fix the page.
***
## **sixth week of work:**
***
During this week we were learning about what is the DOM (acronyms refer to Document Object Model) we saw the different ways to select elements so that we could create validations and events, Knowledge that will make our resolution of the problematic easier.
## **Page content:**
At this point we have a landing page that contains style and structure with css and html, so the idea of this week's work was to add two pages to which we can connect the index, being the login and sign up The next step in the problematic was to create these pages interactively, so that you could go from one page to another and back, in the same way with the forms in which the user is able to enter their data and through a series of validations the inputs will remain green if they are valid or red in case of being invalid, the validity of these will be based on a series of parameters that have been added to a pdf document of 'Requirements' and the validation itself is done in the javascript docs.
